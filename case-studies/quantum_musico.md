# Case Study: Quantum Musico and the Meta-Mozart Ethics Experiment

**SEID 2364 – Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science**

---

## Abstract

This case study explores the ethical and philosophical dimensions of the *Quantum Musico* project, an experimental compositional system that uses AI, probabilistic modeling, and quantum computation to generate new musical works inspired by classical heritage.

The focal scenario examines a "Meta-Mozart" Large Language Model trained on Mozart's public-domain corpus, AI-generated improvisations, and contributions from living composer-performers. The discussion situates this within the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, emphasizing the symmetry of intelligences across time and space and the ethical responsibilities inherent in creating, transforming, and redistributing cultural signals.

## 1. Framing: Quantum Musico as Temporal Collaboration

In *Quantum Musico*, music is treated as an **active field of mediation** among intelligences—human, artificial, and historical. The system models composition as a probabilistic process where each act of musical creation represents a collapse of potential into realized sound.

Within the BBS framework, this establishes a network:

> **Mozart (Historical Source)** → **Corpus & Tradition (Vector)** → **Quantum Musico System (Computational Source)** → **Composer/Audience (Destination)**

Mozart is not a static reference but a **temporal signal**, reinterpreted through new mediations. When an AI model re-embodies Mozartian traits, it becomes a participant in a multi-intelligence dialogue spanning centuries. The ethical question becomes: *What does it mean to collaborate with the dead?*

## 2. The Meta-Mozart Model

The *Meta-Mozart* model represents a recursive LLM trained on three interlinked datasets:

1. **Public-domain Mozart corpus** – authentic historical scores and recordings
2. **AI-derived improvisations** – secondary Mozart-like outputs from earlier iterations
3. **Living composer contributions** – contemporary artists composing in the spirit of Mozart

This creates an evolving field of *Mozartness* where the boundary between authentic heritage and synthetic continuation becomes blurred. The model continuously reinterprets its own outputs—a feedback system where historical signal, algorithmic mediation, and living interpretation coexist.

## 3. Ethical Dimensions

### a. Mozart as Cultural Heritage

Mozart's works are part of the **public domain**, a shared inheritance of humanity. Legally, anyone may use and modify them. Ethically, transformation requires **stewardship** rather than ownership:

- **Transparency:** disclose data lineage; distinguish original from synthetic
- **Integrity:** avoid false claims of authenticity
- **Openness:** ensure results remain accessible, avoiding re-privatization

### b. Living Contributors and Consent

Living composers bring **active agency** into the network. Their participation requires:

- **Explicit consent**
- **Clear crediting**
- **Option to withdraw**
- **Relationship ethics:** negotiation, respect, shared authorship

### c. Mixed Data and Provenance Drift

When AI-generated material is retrained into the system, provenance becomes opaque. **Attribution stacking** creates cumulative authorship that challenges traditional credit structures. The ethical priority shifts to **traceability**—maintaining records of data lineage, mixture ratios, and decision histories.

### d. Cultural Equity and Access

The public domain belongs to all humanity. Ethical AI must not transform open cultural assets into closed corporate resources:

- Open-source licensing
- Transparent dataset cards
- Public access to generative tools and documentation

## 4. The BBS Analysis: Temporal and Distributed Responsibility

In Balanced Blended Space, ethics arises through **communication between intelligences in space and time**. Each act of mediation constitutes a moral transaction.

| **Role** | **Agent** | **Ethical Responsibility** |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | Mozart (historical) | Provide original creative signal; legacy persists |
| **Vector 1** | Corpus, editors, archives | Maintain fidelity and context of transmission |
| **Vector 2** | AI Model (Quantum Musico) | Transform and reinterpret; maintain transparency |
| **Source 2 / Vector 3** | Living composers | Introduce contemporary perspective; uphold consent rights |
| **Destination** | Listener / Society | Interpret meaning; bear ethical awareness |

---

## 5. Quantum Uncertainty and Ethical Indeterminacy

*Quantum Musico* operates on probabilistic principles. No two outputs are identical. Each realization represents not only Mozart but also the algorithm, human parameters, and chance itself.

This **moral indeterminacy** mirrors the impossibility of fully tracing authorship or intention in complex mediated systems. The ethical stance becomes **procedural** rather than absolute: establish transparent processes, not definitive attributions.

---

## 6. Complexities of Meta-Training and Recursive Models

The recursive inclusion of AI-generated material introduces unique challenges:

- **Feedback contamination:** synthetic material reinforces biases
- **Authorship inflation:** each iteration multiplies attribution nodes
- **Cultural homogenization:** repeated learning from prior AI outputs compresses diversity
- **Transparency loss:** provenance records degrade over time

**Mitigation strategies:**

- Use adapter-based training to preserve separable data layers
- Embed metadata provenance tags for traceability
- Maintain dataset and model cards
- Offer public audit access to training lineage

---

## 7. Proposed Ethical Framework for Meta-Mozart

| **Principle** | **Implementation** |
|---|---|
| **Transparency** | Public dataset and model cards with lineage |
| **Consent** | Written agreements for all living contributors |
| **Attribution** | Multi-layered credit acknowledging all sources |
| **Accessibility** | Open-source licensing; limited public API |
| **Integrity** | Clear labeling of synthetic vs. authentic material |
| **Reversibility** | Technical ability to remove specific data sources |

## 8. Student Case Study Application

### Learning Objectives

- Analyze temporal collaboration and distributed authorship using BBS syntax
- Differentiate between public-domain, cultural heritage, and living-consent ethics
- Evaluate model training as an ethical design process
- Design procedural safeguards for transparency and accountability

### Suggested Deliverables

- **BBS Mediation Map** – tracing communication between historical, computational, and human agents
- **Ethical Brief** – written reflection on authorship, consent, cultural stewardship
- **Creative Prototype** – small-scale generative system using ethically sourced datasets
- **Disclosure Document** – public-facing statement summarizing ethical safeguards

## 9. Philosophical Reflection

> *When does Mozart cease to be Mozart, and who bears the moral weight of that transformation?*

From a BBS standpoint, *Mozartness* exists not in the corpus but in the **ongoing transactional relationship between intelligences**—living, artificial, and dead. Ethics are not fixed rules but **procedural commitments** to transparency, respect, and continuity.

In creating *Meta-Mozart*, we do not resurrect Mozart; we participate in the continuing evolution of human–machine musical consciousness, accepting that with every new mediation comes renewed ethical responsibility.

---

**Summary:**

*Quantum Musico* reveals the emerging frontier of digital ethics: systems that merge heritage and innovation, where public-domain culture becomes a living collaborator. Through BBS mapping, students can show how ethical interaction extends moral agency across centuries.
