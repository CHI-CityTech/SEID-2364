## 1. Math and Statistics I

**Expected knowledge:**
- Descriptive and inferential statistics, including hypothesis testing
- Correlation, regression, and causation
- Quantitative reasoning and interpretation of uncertainty
- Statistical misuse and fallacies

**Why:** These skills enable ethical analysis of evidence and validity in data-driven systems.

## 2. Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

**Expected understanding:**
- Core principles of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
- Role of training data, feature selection, and bias in model outcomes
- Conceptual understanding of neural networks, LLMs, and generative AI
- Algorithmic transparency and explainability
- Historical and philosophical perspectives on intelligence

**Why:** Ethical implications depend on how systems learn, represent, and act.

---

## 3. Fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming

**Expected competence:**
- Programming logic and control structures
- Data flow and computational processes
- Proficiency in Python, R, or similar environments

**Why:** Conceptual fluency in computational reasoning helps interpret algorithmic systems ethically.

---

## 4. Web Programming and Application Development

**Expected familiarity:**
- Client–server architectures and data exchange models
- Security, authentication, and user privacy
- How user interfaces and APIs mediate communication and data flow

**Why:** Ethical analysis often involves online mediation.

---

## 5. Digital Communication Systems and Mediation

**Expected familiarity:**
- Digital communication networks and internet protocols
- Platform architectures (social media, collaborative systems)
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous communication models
- Data mediation (filtering, recommendation, curation)
- Role of identity, anonymity, and personalization

**Why:** SEID 2364 examines communication itself as an ethical system.

---

## 6. Research Design

**Expected ability to:**
- Formulate research questions and hypotheses
- Apply appropriate data collection and evaluation methods
- Distinguish qualitative and quantitative approaches
- Communicate research findings clearly

**Why:** Research literacy supports critical evaluation of claims in data science ethics.

---

## 7. Legal Aspects of Data Science

**Expected introductory literacy in:**
- Data protection and privacy law (GDPR, EU frameworks)
- Intellectual property and copyright in data-driven contexts
- Liability and accountability for automated systems
- Digital communication regulation and platform responsibility
- Corporate governance and compliance

**Why:** Legal frameworks define the compliance boundary for deeper ethical reasoning.

---

## 8. Cross-Disciplinary Communication and Collaboration

**Expected development of:**
- Teamwork and project coordination skills
- Oral and written communication for technical and non-technical audiences
- Intercultural and interdisciplinary collaboration awareness
- Emerging ethical sensibility concerning technology's social role

**Why:** Communication is central to SEID 2364; students must express ethical reasoning clearly.
