### *SEID / CHI — Core Concepts and Definitions*

---

## **Centralized Technology**
A technology or capability that begins under the control of a small group, institution, or elite. Access is limited, infrastructure is heavy, and individuals depend on a single point of origin.
- *Examples:* early writing (scribal classes), factory engines, mainframe computers, monolithic LLMs.

---

## **Distributed Technology**
A technology that moves beyond centralized control and becomes accessible to communities, workshops, smaller organizations, or regional systems.
- *Examples:* the printing press, electrified machinery, early personal computers.

---

## **Ubiquitous Technology**
A technology that becomes ambient and embedded throughout the environment. It is encountered so often that it becomes nearly invisible.
- *Examples:* micro-motors in appliances, embedded processors, sensor networks, wireless communication.

---

## **Personal Technology**
A capability that becomes embedded in individual life and cognition. The technology feels natural, intuitive, and is fully under personal control.
- *Examples:* literacy, smartphones, household electricity, future personalized LLMs.

---

## **Symbolic Technology**
A system or method for encoding meaning into structured patterns. Symbolic technologies externalize thought, making meaning transportable.
- *Examples:* speech, writing, mathematics, musical notation, programming languages.

---

## **Conceptual Space (BBS)**
The domain of meaning, abstraction, symbolic representation, and cognitive interpretation. Concepts exist independent of their medium.
- *Examples:* stories, ideas, formal symbols, laws, logic, mathematics.

---

## **Physical Space (BBS)**
The material domain in which objects, substrates, and embodied actions exist.
- *Examples:* clay tablets, books, engines, machines, circuits.

---

## **Virtual Space (BBS)**
The domain that emerges when information transcends physical presence, traveling through mediated, non-local channels.
- *Examples:* telegraphy, radio, analog phone lines, internet communication, digital streams.

---

## **Cognitive Intelligence**
Human or biological intelligence capable of interpretation, creativity, symbolic reasoning, and meaning-making.

---

## **Computational Intelligence**
Algorithmic or machine-based processes that manipulate encoded information. Operates on data rather than meaning.
- *Examples:* search algorithms, LLM inference, sorting, pattern detection.

---

## **Mediation**
Any transformation a signal undergoes as it moves between source and destination. Mediations alter structure, form, or accessibility of information.
- *Examples:* writing, printing, encoding, electrical signaling, computation.

---

## **Arc of Engineering**
A recurring historical pattern in which major technologies evolve from centralized origins to distributed access, then to ubiquitous embedding, and ultimately to personal integration.

---

## **Personalized LLM**
A small, local, contextually aligned language model tailored to an individual's cognitive patterns, goals, and creative workflows. Considered a potential future stage in AI's trajectory.

---

## **Virtuality Before Digitality**
The idea that information became virtual long before computers: the moment symbols were transmitted electrically (e.g., Morse code), they entered virtual space—even if not yet digital or computational.

---

## **Durable Symbolic Encoding**
A representational form that preserves meaning across time. Writing transformed symbolic sound (ephemeral) into durable structure (inscription).

---

## **Distributed Cognition**
The idea that cognition occurs not only within individuals but through interactions with tools, systems, people, and environments.
- *Relevance:* All arcs of engineering illustrate shifts in externalized cognitive load.
