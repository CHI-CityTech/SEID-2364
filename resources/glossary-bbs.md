# Balanced Blended Space (BBS) Glossary – Core Concepts

This glossary defines essential terminology of the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework for use in **SEID 2364** and related CHI projects. It establishes shared language for describing mediation, intelligence, symmetry, and perception within combinative reality.

---

## Foundational Terms

**Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** – A universal framework describing interactions among **physical**, **virtual**, and **conceptual** spaces, emphasizing balance and symmetry among intelligences and modalities.

**Combinative Reality** – The total field of overlapping physical, virtual, and conceptual realities within which all agents act and interact.

**Intelligence** – The capacity to perceive, process, and act upon information to effect change. In BBS, intelligence is defined behaviorally through mediation.

**Cognitive Intelligence** – Biological intelligence expressed through awareness, reasoning, and decision-making.

**Computational Intelligence** – Artificial or machine-based intelligence operating algorithmically within virtual systems.

**Agent** – Any entity (human, machine, or hybrid) capable of perception, mediation, and action within or across spaces.

**Mediation Pathway (MP)** – The route through which information is transferred or transformed between agents or across spaces. Each MP includes **Source**, **Vector**, and **Destination** roles.

## Spaces and Ontological Composition

| **Space** | **Constituent Unit** | **Transformation Medium** | **Example** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Physical** | Atoms / energy quanta | Force, motion, interaction | Light, sound, touch |
| **Virtual** | Numbers / code states | Computation | Simulation, synthesis, visualization |
| **Conceptual** | Symbols / relations | Interpretation | Language, mathematics, logic |

**Virtual Space** – Defined as a **numerical representation of state**, ontologically real, differing in substrate from physical space.

**Conceptual Space** – The abstract domain of meaning, symbol, and relation; the interpretive layer connecting physical and virtual experience.

---

## Mediation and Representation

**Mediation Event** – Any instance of transformation, transmission, or reinterpretation of information across agents or spaces.

**Vector Representation** – Notation describing flow: *Source → Vector → Destination*.

**Qualitative Mapping** – Representing relationships based on interpretive (non-numerical) distance or effect.

**Combinative Mapping** – Diagrammatic method illustrating interactions among multiple spaces, intelligences, and perceptual fields.

---

## Integrative Concepts

**Situational Awareness** – The capacity to perceive and act within complex blended environments, recognizing concurrent stimuli from multiple spaces.

**Combinative Literacy** – The ability to interpret and act fluently across physical, virtual, and conceptual domains.

**Ethical Mediation** – The analysis of how responsibility and moral accountability flow through communication pathways across intelligences and spaces.

**Ethical Distance** – The gap created by mediation between intent and consequence, perception and reality, design and impact.

---

## Glossary of Additional Terms

**Meta-Symmetry** – The overarching equivalence unifying all structural relationships within BBS, ensuring that mediation principles apply uniformly across intelligences, spaces, and perceptual fields.

**Responsibility Diffusion** – The phenomenon where ethical accountability becomes unclear or distributed across multiple agents and systems, making individual responsibility harder to identify.

**Transparency (in BBS)** – Clear visibility of mediation pathways, sources of information, and flows of agency and responsibility.

**Agency** – The capacity and freedom of an agent to make meaningful decisions and effect change within a mediated system.
