# [DRAFT] Weeks 8–9 Assignment: Quantum Musico Ethics Analysis with BBS Mapping

**Status:** Under consideration for Weeks 8–9 (Ethical Ambiguity & Wicked Problems)  
**Due:** Week 9 end  
**Submission:** PDF or shared document with embedded diagrams

## Overview

Building on the Week 7 case exploration and the Quantum Musico core reading, this assignment asks you to conduct a **structured ethical analysis** of the Meta-Mozart system using the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework as your primary analytical tool.

Your goal is to map how responsibility, agency, and ethical accountability flow across intelligences (historical, computational, and living) and spaces (physical, virtual, conceptual), and to identify specific points where ethical pressure or ambiguity arises.

## Instructions

Write a **4–6 page analysis** (1,200–1,800 words) with the following structure:

### 1. Case Summary (300–400 words)

Clearly describe the Quantum Musico / Meta-Mozart system:
- What does it do?
- What data does it use (public-domain Mozart, AI-generated material, living contributions)?
- Who are the key agents (human, computational, institutional)?
- What is the intended value or impact?

### 2. BBS Mediation Map (Diagram + 200-word explanation)

Create a visual diagram showing:
- **Sources:** Historical (Mozart), computational (Quantum Musico system), living (contemporary composers)
- **Vectors:** The pathways through which each source influences the others (archives, algorithms, artistic collaboration)
- **Destinations:** Who/what is affected (audiences, composers, cultural heritage communities)
- **Spaces:** Are flows primarily in physical, virtual, or conceptual space? How do they cross?

Then write a brief explanation of this map: What does it reveal about how responsibility is distributed or diffused?

### 3. Ethical Dimensions (800–1,000 words)

Analyze at least **three** of the following ethical layers:

**a) Public Domain Heritage**
- Mozart's works are common cultural property. What obligations does *using* them entail?
- How does computational transformation differ ethically from human interpretation?
- Who should benefit from commercially deployed Meta-Mozart systems?

**b) Living Contributors & Consent**
- Contemporary composers consent to join the training data. What does equitable collaboration look like?
- Can consent be withdrawn? What would that mean technically and ethically?
- How is authorship and attribution handled at scale?

**c) Provenance & Transparency**
- When AI-generated material is retrained into the system, provenance becomes opaque. Is this an ethical problem?
- Should users know whether they're "listening to" Mozart, the algorithm, or a living composer—or is that distinction meaningless?
- What would dataset documentation look like?

**d) Cultural Stewardship vs. Appropriation**
- Classical music is a global heritage. Does that mean anyone can transform it?
- What responsibilities do technologists have toward the *meaning* and *context* of cultural work?
- How do different cultures approach ownership and adaptation differently?

**e) Agency Distribution**
- Where is decision-making power concentrated in this system?
- Which agents (human, AI, institutional) can act autonomously? Which are constrained?
- Using BBS language: Where is responsibility most diffuse, and is that ethically problematic?

### 4. Stakeholder Perspectives (400–600 words)

Analyze the case from **at least three** stakeholder viewpoints:

- **Living Composers:** What do they gain or lose?
- **Audiences/Users:** What are they experiencing, and do they understand the mediation?
- **Cultural Heritage Communities:** Do they have a voice?
- **AI Developers/Institutions:** What pressures shape their choices?
- **Mozart's Legacy (Conceptual):** Does a three-century-old composer have interests? What would honoring them mean?

For each perspective, use BBS language: What mediation pathways affect their agency and accountability?

### 5. Ethical Framework & Judgment (300–400 words)

Drawing on at least one ethical framework from the course (consequentialism, deontology, care ethics, etc.):

- What does this framework reveal about Quantum Musico?
- What does it obscure or leave out?
- What is *your* reasoned judgment about whether Meta-Mozart, as described, is ethically sound?
- What conditions or guardrails would make it more acceptable? What would make it unacceptable?

---

## Structure & Style

- **Clear section headings** and subheadings
- **Active voice** where possible
- **Inline citations** of course readings (BBS glossary, Quantum Musico case study, ethical frameworks)
- **Embedded diagram** (or diagram in appendix) with figure caption
- **250–500 word reflection:** What was difficult about this analysis? How did BBS help or constrain your thinking?

## Evaluation Criteria

| **Criterion** | **Excellent** | **Good** | **Developing** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Case Understanding** | Clear, detailed summary of system and agents | Adequate summary with minor gaps | Unclear or incomplete description |
| **BBS Application** | Insightful mediation map; thoughtful spatial/agency analysis | Competent use of BBS concepts | Superficial or unclear BBS application |
| **Ethical Depth** | Multiple frameworks considered; nuanced assessment | Solid analysis of 2–3 dimensions; clear stance | One-dimensional analysis; unclear reasoning |
| **Stakeholder Analysis** | Genuine attempt to honor multiple perspectives | Polite acknowledgment of other views | Limited or stereotyped perspectives |
| **Personal Reflection** | Clear growth in thinking; honest about tensions | Thoughtful reflection on own framework | Generic reflection; missing nuance |
| **Writing & Organization** | Polished, persuasive, well-cited | Clear organization; adequate support | Unclear argument; weak citations |

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't over-explain BBS.** Assume your reader knows it; focus on *applying* it to Quantum Musico.
2. **Embrace ambiguity.** This case has no single "right" answer. Show your reasoning, not just your conclusion.
3. **Use the diagram strategically.** A good BBS map can replace 500 words of prose explanation.
4. **Ground ethical claims.** Every value judgment should follow from a framework or principle you've named.
5. **Cite the course case study.** The Quantum Musico document is your primary text; use it liberally.

**This assignment models how ethical reasoning works in practice: careful analysis, multiple perspectives, and willingness to sit with ambiguity while still taking a reasoned stance.**
