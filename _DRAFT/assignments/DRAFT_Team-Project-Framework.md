# [DRAFT] Team Project Assignment Framework

**Status:** Under consideration for Weeks 12–14 (Team Development, Iteration, Final Presentations)  
**Overall Structure:** Individual/team progression from proposal → prototype → presentation

---

## Part 1: Team Project Proposal (Week 12)

**Due:** End of Week 12  
**Format:** 2–3 page document + 1-page team charter  
**Purpose:** Define your ethical challenge and approach

### Proposal Contents

#### 1. Project Title & Domain Selection
- Select one domain from SEID case studies or propose your own
- Examples: Healthcare AI, Social Media Ethics, Cultural Heritage & AI, Algorithmic Governance, Surveillance & Trust, Human–AI Collaboration, Environmental Data Stewardship

#### 2. Ethical Challenge Statement (250 words)
- What specific ethical problem or tension are you investigating?
- Why is it important? Who is affected?
- What makes it "wicked" or ambiguous (i.e., no obvious right answer)?

#### 3. Approach & Methodology (400–500 words)

**a) Analytical Framework**
- Will you use BBS mapping? Stakeholder analysis? Ethical frameworks?
- How will you structure your investigation?

**b) Research or Design Method**
- Will you conduct interviews, analyze archival materials, design a prototype, simulate scenarios?
- What makes your approach rigorous and creative?

**c) Deliverables**
- What will you produce? (written analysis, BBS diagrams, policy brief, prototype, artistic intervention, etc.)
- How will you communicate findings to different audiences?

**d) Team Roles (if applicable)**
- Who owns what aspects?
- How will you distribute work and ensure all voices contribute equally?

#### 4. Preliminary BBS Framework
- Sketch the key mediation pathways relevant to your problem
- Identify sources of agency, vectors of mediation, and points of ethical concern
- This doesn't need to be perfect—it's a thinking tool

## Part 2: Iterative Development & Peer Feedback (Weeks 12–13)

**Checkpoints:**
- **Week 12 End:** Proposal submission + peer feedback exchanged
- **Week 13 Early:** Teams revise based on feedback
- **Week 13 Mid:** Progress report + prototype/draft materials shared
- **Week 13 Late:** Final iteration based on additional feedback

**Peer Feedback Format:**
- Each team reviews 2 other proposals using a simple rubric
- Feedback focuses on **clarity, ambition, and ethical rigor**—not trying to "fix" the project
- Teams reflect on feedback in a 250-word response (optional but encouraged)

---

## Part 3: Final Project Deliverables (Week 14)

### A. Written Analysis or Brief (3–5 pages)

Depending on your domain, choose one format:

**Option 1: Ethical Case Analysis**
- Problem definition
- Stakeholder perspectives (≥3)
- BBS mediation map with explanation
- Applicable ethical frameworks
- Reasoned judgment and recommendations

**Option 2: Policy or Design Brief**
- Executive summary
- Problem context
- Proposed solution (policy, design intervention, educational initiative)
- Implementation challenges and trade-offs
- How BBS principles inform your proposal

**Option 3: Research Report**
- Research question(s)
- Methodology
- Findings and analysis
- Implications for ethics, design, or governance
- Limitations and future directions

### B. Visual Representation

At least one substantial visual artifact:
- **BBS Mediation Map(s)** showing flow of agency, information, responsibility
- **Stakeholder Diagram** with competing perspectives
- **Timeline of Ethical Evolution** (e.g., how Platform Archaeology traces change over time)
- **Prototype or Simulation** (if your project is design-focused)
- **Infographic or Policy Brief Design**

**Quality standard:** Clear enough to stand alone; sophisticated enough to show deep thinking

### C. Recorded or Live Presentation (12–15 minutes)

**Content:**
- Problem statement and why it matters (2 min)
- Your analytical approach and key findings (6–8 min)
- BBS framework application (2–3 min)
- Recommendations or implications (2–3 min)
- Personal reflection on ethical growth through the project (1 min)

**Format options:**
- Live presentation to cohort (Week 14)
- Recorded video (for asynchronous participation)
- Interactive presentation (if team prefers dialogue)

**Audience:** Faculty and peers. Assume they know SEID concepts but not your specific domain.

### D. Team Reflection & Individual Self-Assessment

**Joint team reflection** (1 page):
- What was most challenging about the collaborative process?
- How did diverse perspectives strengthen (or complicate) the work?
- If you incorporated AI (optional), what did that collaboration reveal?
- What would you do differently next time?

**Individual self-assessment** (250–500 words privately submitted):
- What was your role and contribution?
- How did your ethical thinking evolve through this project?
- What did you learn about working across disciplines or with AI?
- How will this project shape your future work in data science or related fields?

## Evaluation Rubric

| **Dimension** | **Excellent** | **Proficient** | **Developing** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ethical Clarity** | Problem is well-defined, genuinely ambiguous, and significant | Problem is clear; some ambiguity explored | Problem statement vague or oversimplified |
| **BBS Application** | Sophisticated use of mediation models; reveals ethical dynamics clearly | Competent BBS application; maps key relationships | Surface-level BBS use; unclear connection to ethical issues |
| **Stakeholder Analysis** | Genuine engagement with ≥3 perspectives; tensions honestly portrayed | Multiple perspectives included; some depth | Limited or stereotyped perspectives |
| **Analytical Rigor** | Frameworks applied thoughtfully; evidence or reasoning is strong | Sound analysis; adequately supported | Weak support; reasoning unclear |
| **Collaboration** | Clear division of labor; all voices heard; productive disagreement | Team worked well together; fair contribution | Some team friction; unclear who did what |
| **Presentation** | Compelling, polished, well-organized; appropriate for audience | Clear and professional; adequate detail | Unclear, unprepared, or inappropriate for audience |
| **Personal Reflection** | Honest growth narrative; specific examples; implications for future practice | Thoughtful reflection; genuine engagement | Generic or superficial reflection |

## FAQ

**Q: Can our project just be a written analysis, or do we need a prototype?**  
A: Writing is primary. Prototypes or creative artifacts are encouraged if they serve your ethical analysis—not instead of it.

**Q: Should our team include someone with technical AI skills?**  
A: Not necessary. Teams benefit from diverse perspectives (humanities, design, science, policy, arts). Technical depth helps but isn't required.

**Q: Can we work with an AI collaborator?**  
A: Yes. If you do, document the collaboration fully and reflect on how it shaped your thinking. See AI Collaboration Guidelines in course resources.

**Q: What if our findings don't lead to neat solutions?**  
A: That's authentic. Ethical analysis often reveals tensions that can't be "solved"—only managed thoughtfully. Honest acknowledgment of complexity is valued.
