# [DRAFT] Week 7 Assignment: Ethical Ambiguity Case Exploration Brief

**Status:** Under consideration for Week 7 (Legal Contexts & EU AI Act II)  
**Due:** Before Week 8 session  
**Submission:** Include as a labeled entry in your Ethical Logbook

---

## Overview

This low-stakes assignment prepares you for the Quantum Musico case study and subsequent team projects. Your goal is to identify and briefly explore a real-world example of ethical ambiguity in a data-driven or AI system—a case where reasonable people disagree, where competing values are at stake, or where the "right" answer is unclear.

This entry will help you practice applying **BBS concepts** (mediation, agency, responsibility diffusion) to a concrete scenario before diving into the deeper Quantum Musico analysis.

---

## Instructions

Choose a news article, academic case study, or policy document that presents a real-world AI system or data practice with genuine ethical complexity. Then respond to the following prompts in **300–500 words**:

### 1. System and Context
What is the technology or practice? Where/how is it deployed? Who operates it?

### 2. The Ethical Tensions
What competing values or stakeholder interests create the ambiguity? (Examples: innovation vs. privacy; efficiency vs. fairness; cultural heritage vs. open research; surveillance for safety vs. chilling effects)

**Key question:** Why is there no obvious "right answer"?

### 3. Stakeholders and Their Perspectives
Map at least 3 different stakeholder groups and what each stands to gain or lose. Use a simple **BBS lens**: Where is agency concentrated? Where is responsibility diffuse?

### 4. Mediation Pathways
How does technology mediate (or obscure) the ethical relationship between stakeholders? Consider:
- Physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces
- Where information flows and who controls it
- Points where distance or opacity create ethical problems

### 5. Your Reasoning
What framework or value system do *you* apply to think about this case? Where do you lean, and why? What would change your mind?

## Format

- Submit this entry in your **Ethical Logbook** and label clearly:
  `Week 7 – Ethical Ambiguity Case Exploration`
- You may bring this case to Week 8 for peer discussion and further development

---

## Purpose

- Begin thinking critically about cases where ethics is **not** black-and-white.
- Practice **BBS mapping** on a real case before the Quantum Musico deep dive.
- Identify potential cases for your team project work (Weeks 12–14).
- Connect personal ethical reasoning to analytic frameworks.

---

## Evaluation

This is exploratory and informal—not graded for "correctness" but for **thoughtful engagement** with ambiguity, explicit BBS application, and willingness to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously.

---

## Examples of Suitable Cases

- AI trained on cultural heritage materials WITHOUT consent from originating communities
- Facial recognition accuracy varies by demographics—should deployment be paused or improved first?
- Predictive policing reduces crime but increases surveillance of marginalized communities
- Algorithmic pricing in healthcare: efficient but feels exploitative to some
- Open-sourcing LLM weights: innovation vs. potential harm
- Content moderation: balancing free speech, mental health, and extremism prevention

---

**Note:** If you're struggling to find ambiguity in your case (i.e., it feels clearly "right" or "wrong"), that's often a sign that the ethics are more clear-cut. Look for cases where *different communities reasonably disagree* on how to proceed.
