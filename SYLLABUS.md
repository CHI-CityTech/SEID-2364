## Course Description

This course examines the societal and ethical dimensions of data science within a rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, algorithmic governance, and digital communication. Students explore how ethical reasoning, social responsibility, and cultural context intersect with the collection, analysis, and application of data.

Ethical responsibility emerges within data-driven systems through patterns of design, interaction, and decision-making that extend beyond purely technical concerns. Ethical challenges associated with data-intensive technologies include fairness and bias, privacy and surveillance, accountability, automation, and institutional governance.

Grounded in the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, the course treats ethics as a dynamic process of mediation among human, computational, and institutional intelligences. Students analyze both clear and ambiguous ethical situations—ranging from privacy and surveillance to authorship, bias, cultural heritage, and the moral status of AI systems—through reflective discussions, case studies, and multi-modal projects.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** ethical issues arising in data science and machine intelligence, including AI, within complex, mediated environments that combine virtual, physical, societal, and institutional domains.

2. **Apply** ethical approaches and analytical tools to evaluate decisions and actions within hybrid human–machine systems (including AI) operating in data-driven socio-technical contexts.

3. **Evaluate** the ethical implications of data-driven and computational systems, as well as the policies that govern them, by assessing their impacts on stakeholders, power relations, trust, and institutional responsibility within society.

4. **Develop** and articulate a personal ethical framework for responsible professional practice in environments shaped by data, algorithms, and human–machine interaction.

5. **Communicate** ethical reasoning clearly and persuasively across diverse audiences and modalities, including written, oral, visual, and AI-mediated contexts.

6. **Reflect** on how the design and modification of data-driven environments influence human behavior, social structures, and societal outcomes, revising ethical judgments in response to emerging complexity.

## Teaching Approach

The course employs an **experiential and practice-based teaching approach** that emphasizes active participation, reflection, and analysis within the socio-technical environments under study.

Rather than relying primarily on lecture, instruction integrates:

- **Discussion and case analysis** in live and mediated formats
- **Applied exercises** situating ethical reasoning within lived and mediated contexts
- **Reflective activities** in face-to-face, online, and embedded social-media environments
- **Direct engagement** with agentic and automated systems
- **Synchronous and asynchronous communication** pathways

Students encounter ethical questions as they arise in practice, not solely through retrospective analysis. The course intentionally exposes students to multiple modes of communication (text, visual, mediated, non-verbal) to support analysis of how meaning, intent, responsibility, and trust are shaped by mediation.

**Delivery Modalities:**

- **Face-to-face** (Vienna residencies, weeks 1–2, 11–14)
- **Synchronous online** (weeks 3, 5, 7, 10, 14)
- **Asynchronous** (weeks 4, 6, 8–9)
- **Hybrid/Embedded** (weeks 11–13 with live social-media environment)

## Assessment

Student performance is assessed primarily through project-based and reflective work that evaluates ethical reasoning in complex societal and socio-technical contexts. Assessments emphasize analysis, articulation, and iterative refinement of ethical judgment, rather than memorization.

### Assessment Components

| **Component** | **Description** | **Weight** |
|---|---|---|
| **Applied Ethical Projects** | Multiple projects analyzing data-driven or computational systems, policies, or socio-technical environments. Identify ethical risks, map agency and responsibility, evaluate impacts, articulate ethically informed positions. Individual or collaborative. | 50% |
| **Personal Ethical Statement** | Individual statement articulating ethical assumptions, priorities, and decision-making approach in relation to data science and computation. Developed iteratively; must demonstrate critical reflection and engagement with course concepts. | 30% |
| **Participation & Reflection Logs** | Weekly engagement, discussions, AI reflection journals, and engagement across modalities. | 20% |

**Minimum passing grade:** 60% (per Modul University grading scale)

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI and related computational systems are a **central subject of study** in this course. In some course activities and assignments, students will engage directly with AI systems as part of collaborative, analytical, or investigative work.

AI systems are examined not only as tools or objects of analysis, but also as **collaborative agents** whose roles, limitations, and ethical implications are critically assessed.

### AI Use Requirements:

- All AI interactions must be **documented and attributed**
- Students must explicitly analyze **ethical implications** of AI involvement
- **Responsibility and authorship** remain fully human
- **Transparency** in attribution and process is mandatory
- Students examine **autonomy, bias, and accountability** in AI systems

This course models responsible AI use in alignment with the **EU AI Act** and **BBS ethical mediation principles**.
