**Modul University Vienna – Spring 2026**

**Instructor:** Dr. David B. Smith  
**Credits:** 6 ECTS  
**Course Format:** Integrated Learning (IL)  
**Weekly Hours:** 3.00  
**Recommended Prerequisite:** Legal Aspects of Data Science

## 🧭 Overview

**SEID 2364** explores the societal, cultural, and ethical dimensions of data science. The course examines how intelligent systems shape decision-making, communication, and human values. It is grounded in the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, which models how ethics and agency operate across human, computational, and institutional systems.

Students learn to recognize ethical ambiguity, analyze complex sociotechnical systems, and construct their own personal ethical frameworks. The course integrates both human–human and human–AI collaboration to foster reflective and responsible data practices.

---

## 🎯 Core Goals

- Develop literacy in **ethical reasoning**, data governance, and social accountability.
- Apply the **BBS model** to visualize responsibility and mediation between agents.
- Engage in case-based learning, including **Quantum Musico**, **EU AI Act**, and **Cultural Heritage & AI**.
- Build practical experience working with AI collaborators in real-world ethical analysis.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course uses a **blended, multimodal format** combining:

- **Face-to-Face sessions** (Vienna residencies)
- **Synchronous online seminars**
- **Asynchronous reflective activities and AI-assisted dialogues**
- **Embedded social-media environments** (private Discord/Mastodon labs)

The semester follows a 14-unit sequence progressing from individual inquiry → team collaboration → AI-integrated practice → final ethical synthesis.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** ethical issues arising in data science and machine intelligence, including AI, within complex mediated environments.
2. **Apply** ethical approaches and analytical tools to evaluate decisions within hybrid human–machine systems.
3. **Evaluate** the ethical implications of data-driven systems and policies affecting stakeholders and institutional responsibility.
4. **Develop** and articulate a personal ethical framework for responsible practice in data-driven environments.
5. **Communicate** ethical reasoning clearly across diverse audiences and modalities, including written, oral, visual, and AI-mediated contexts.
6. **Reflect** on how design and modification of data-driven environments influence human behavior and societal outcomes.

## 🤖 AI in This Course

AI is integrated as both a **subject of study and a collaborator**:

- **Subject:** Students directly analyze AI systems, bias, authorship, and ethical implications.
- **Collaborator:** Students may work with AI as a team member, documenting interactions and ethical implications.
- **Tool:** AI systems support research, writing, and reflective practice, with transparent attribution.

All AI participation must be **documented and ethically justified**.
