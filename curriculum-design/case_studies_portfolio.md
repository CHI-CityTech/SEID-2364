---

## 6. Social-Media Ethics, Identity & Representation

### Instructor Examples
- **Algorithmic Amplification** – radicalization and emotional targeting
- **Avatar Identity in Virtual Spaces** – anonymity, role fluidity, community norms
- **Meme Culture & Appropriation** – stereotype propagation

### Student-Directed Examples
- Ethnography of an online community
- Case study on moderation decisions and ethical guideline enforcement

---

## 7. Legal Frameworks & Algorithmic Governance (EU AI Act)

### Instructor Examples
- **AI System Misclassification** – risk categories and real-world harms
- **GDPR Conflicts** – prediction based on legally collected data
- **Transparency vs. Trade Secrets** – balancing regulation and innovation

### Student-Directed Examples
- Rewrite an article of the AI Act for a chosen system
- Classify an existing AI system under the EU risk framework

## 8. Guidelines for Student-Selected Case Studies

Any student-selected case study must:

1. **Involve genuine ethical complexity** – multiple stakeholders, contested values, no obvious "right" answer

2. **Address data-driven or computational systems** – AI, algorithms, automation, information flows

3. **Be grounded in real-world evidence** – news articles, policy documents, research, or archival materials

4. **Allow BBS application** – can be mapped using mediation pathways, source–vector–destination syntax

5. **Be accessible to the cohort** – sufficient background information provided

6. **Have reasonable scope** – analyzable within the project timeline (4–6 weeks)
