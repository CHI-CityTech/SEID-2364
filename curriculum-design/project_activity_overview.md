# Project Activity Overview – SEID 2364

**Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science**

Projects in SEID 2364 are designed as **multimodal explorations of real-world ethical challenges** within data-driven systems. Each student will engage across three collaborative configurations over the semester:

1. **Individual Human Projects** – reflective inquiries or micro-case analyses
2. **Human-Human Team Projects** – small interdisciplinary groups examining shared ethical problems
3. **Human-AI Collaborative Projects** – teams working alongside AI associates, treating them as cognitive partners

Students select their ethical challenge from a **domain matrix**—healthcare, algorithmic governance, surveillance, autonomous mobility, financial tech, educational analytics, or creative AI. Within that domain, students investigate *who holds agency*, *how mediation shapes accountability*, and *how ethical responsibility distributes*.

---

## Deliverable Formats

Each project generates outputs in **multiple modalities**, demonstrating ethical literacy through both content and form:

### Written Analysis (Textual)
A concise ethical case study or research brief articulating:
- The ethical dilemma or challenge
- Key stakeholders and their perspectives
- Ethical frameworks or theories applied
- Argumentation and evidence

### Visual or Spatial Representation (Diagrammatic)
A **BBS mediation map** or flowchart showing:
- The flow of intelligence, information, and consequence across spaces
- Agency and responsibility distribution
- Points of ethical risk or ambiguity

### Oral/Performance Component (Communicative)
- A presentation, recorded dialogue, or interactive session
- Can include AI participation with full documentation
- Demonstrates reasoning process, not just conclusions

### Reflective Component (Metacognitive)
A short journal or AI log analyzing:
- How communication and collaboration occurred
- Ethical decisions made during the project
- How collaboration itself was an ethical act
- Personal learning and framework development

---

## Project Progression Through the Semester

### **Weeks 1–7: Individual Foundations**

Students complete **individual ethical reflections** and micro-projects:

- **Personal Ethical Compass** (Week 2) – Self-awareness about values and assumptions
- **BBS Mediation Map** (Week 3) – Understanding how mediation shapes ethics
- **Ethical Logbook** (Weeks 4–9) – Ongoing reflection on readings, discussions, cases
- **EU AI Act Case Brief** (Week 5–7) – Applying regulatory frameworks to specific scenarios

---

### **Weeks 8–9: Case-Based Deep Dives**

Students engage intensively with **instructor-provided case studies**:

- **Quantum Musico Analysis** – Authorship, cultural heritage, AI-generated content
- **Social-Media Ethics Lab** – Embedded participation and observation

**Deliverables:**
- Case analysis essay or multimedia report
- BBS mediation map for the case
- Reflection on how the case challenges personal ethical framework

---

### **Weeks 10–11: Team Formation and Planning**

Students form teams and begin **human-human collaboration**:

**Activities:**
- Select domain and ethical focus
- Identify research questions
- Develop team proposal and communication norms
- Design initial BBS framework for the project

**Deliverables:**
- Team Proposal Document (problem statement, approach, timeline)
- Preliminary BBS Diagram
- Team Charter (roles, communication norms, decision-making process)

---

### **Week 10 (Optional): Introduce AI Collaborator**

Teams may opt to incorporate an **AI agent as a designed team member**:

**AI Teammate Dossier includes:**
- Role and ethical orientation (e.g., skeptic, compliance officer, creative partner)
- Prompts or instructions given to the AI
- Guidelines for ethical interaction
- Documentation of dialogue and emergent behavior

**Ethical Requirements:**
- All AI contributions must be transparently attributed
- Teams must reflect on how AI affected reasoning and outcomes
- Responsibility for decisions remains fully human

---

### **Weeks 12–13: Development and Iteration**

Teams **prototype, test, and refine** their ethical frameworks:

**Activities:**
- Conduct stakeholder research or case interviews
- Draft ethical framework or policy proposal
- Create multimedia presentation materials
- Implement peer and AI feedback
- Iterate on BBS diagrams

**Deliverables:**
- Synthesis Presentation (15–20 minutes)
- Updated BBS Diagrams
- Full project report or case study
- Peer feedback synthesis and response

---

### **Week 14: Final Presentation and Reflection**

Teams **present findings** and students **synthesize learning**:

**Deliverables:**
- **Final Project Presentation** – 15–20 minute presentation to cohort and faculty
- **Individual Reflective Portfolio** – synthesis of personal ethical growth
- **Group Self-Assessment** – reflection on collaboration and ethical process
- **Personal Ethical Statement** – articulation of refined ethical framework

---

## Guidelines for AI Use in Human Teams

Teams may employ AI tools without treating them as formal collaborators:

**Permitted AI Roles:**
1. **Analytical Instrument** – background research, summarization (humans verify)
2. **Stimulus for Debate** – AI generates counterpoints (human analysis follows)
3. **Documentation Assistant** – manages notes without shaping decisions
4. **Scenario Simulator** – produces hypothetical cases for analysis
5. **Style Mediator** – supports clarity or translation, not argumentation

**Requirements:**
- Document how AI was used
- Verify accuracy independently
- Reflect on how it affected human reasoning
- Maintain transparent authorship

---

## AI as Designed Teammate

Teams may design an **AI agent as an equal team member**:

**Process:**
1. Define the agent's ethical role (e.g., cultural interpreter, sustainability auditor)
2. Create initial prompts and guidelines
3. Hold structured discussions with the AI throughout the project
4. Document all interactions and emergent behavior
5. Reflect on what the collaboration reveals about machine and human reasoning

**Deliverable:**
- **AI Teammate Dossier** – profile, dialogue traces, ethical reflections

---

## Integration with CHI Ecosystem

Teams may extend projects beyond the classroom by linking to **CHI collaborative infrastructures**:

- GitHub repositories for shared research
- BBS modeling protocols for ethical visualization
- Cross-repository commentary and ethical review exchanges
- Asynchronous collaboration with other CHI projects

This creates a **living research ecosystem** where student work contributes to ongoing CHI initiatives in Blended Reality, BBS, and Collaborative AI.

## Summary

Through individual, team, and hybrid collaborations, SEID 2364 positions students as practitioners and analysts of **mediated ethics**. Whether working with humans, AI systems, or distributed networks of intelligences, students engage in a continual process of reflection, accountability, and transformation—embodying the core BBS principle that ethical understanding arises through **communication within space and time**.
