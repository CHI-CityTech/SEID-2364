# **SEID 2364 – Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science**

### **Proposed Syllabus**

**Modul University Vienna – Spring 2026**\
**Instructor:** Dr. David B. Smith\
**Credits:** 6 ECTS\
**Recommended Prerequisite:** Legal Aspects of Data Science

---

## **1. Course Description**

This course examines the societal and ethical dimensions of data science within a rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, algorithmic governance, and digital communication. Students explore how ethical reasoning, social responsibility, and cultural context intersect with the collection, analysis, and application of data.

Grounded in the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework, the course treats ethics as a dynamic process of mediation among human, computational, and institutional intelligences. Students analyze both clear and ambiguous ethical situations—ranging from privacy and surveillance to authorship, bias, cultural heritage, and the moral status of AI systems—through reflective discussions, case studies, and multi-modal projects.

---

## **2. Detailed Course Description**

*Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science* introduces students to classical and contemporary ethical frameworks and explores how they adapt to data-intensive and AI-driven contexts. Using the BBS framework, students learn to visualize the flow of information and responsibility between agents (human and nonhuman) and across physical, virtual, and conceptual spaces.

Case studies include:

- **Quantum Musico / Meta-Mozart** – authorship, identity, and cultural ethics in AI-generated music.
- **The EU AI Act** – regulation as ethical mediation.
- **Cultural Representation & Appropriation in AI** – diffusion of responsibility in generative systems.
- **Algorithmic Bias & Governance** – ambiguity and wicked problems in real-world deployments.

For a full list of potential case studies, please see this document [SEID Case Studies](./seid_2364_case_studies.md)

By the end of the course, students will be able to apply a structured, culturally aware, and critically reflective ethical process to any data science environment.

## **3. Learning Outcomes**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** ethical, legal, and social implications of data-driven systems using established and emerging ethical frameworks.
2. **Apply** the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) model to interpret ethical mediation across human and AI domains.
3. **Evaluate** complex cases involving privacy, surveillance, bias, authorship, and cultural heritage from multiple ethical perspectives.
4. **Develop** and articulate a personal ethical framework integrating cultural, professional, and technological considerations.
5. **Collaborate** within human and human–AI teams to design and assess ethically informed data-driven projects.
