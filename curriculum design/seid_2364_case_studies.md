# **SEID 2364 – Case Study Portfolio**  
### *Societal and Ethical Impacts of Data Science*  
**Modul University Vienna – Spring 2026**

This document provides a flexible, extensible set of **ethical case studies** appropriate for SEID 2364. It includes instructor-provided examples and broader domains students may select from for their final project. Many cases can be generalized across artistic, scientific, cultural, and computational practices.

---

# **1. Privacy, Surveillance & Data Governance**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **Facial Recognition in Public Spaces** – governance, proportionality, chilling effects.
- **Health Data & Wearables** – consent collapse, non‑health inferences.
- **Smart City Infrastructure** – ownership of environmental data and sensor fusion.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Privacy mapping of a campus or digital platform.
- Analysis of a real privacy breach or governance failure.

---

# **2. Bias, Fairness & Algorithmic Discrimination**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **Hiring Algorithm Bias** – proxy attributes and discriminatory outcomes.
- **Predictive Policing Systems** – contested risk scores and false positives.
- **Loan Approval Algorithms** – structural bias in financial models.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Audit a synthetic ML model for disparate impact.
- Compare fairness frameworks across jurisdictions.

---

# **3. Intellectual Property, Authorship & Creative AI**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **Quantum Musico / Meta‑Mozart** – hybrid authorship, cultural heritage, ownership.
- **AI‑Generated Visual Art** – scraping, style mimicry, derivative works.
- **Digital Resurrection of Deceased Performers** – consent and legacy rights.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
Students may generalize the Quantum Musico framework to any creative or intellectual practice:
- **Film and Animation** – AI‑generated sequences, voice cloning, posthumous casting.
- **Painting and Illustration** – style-transfer ethics, cultural lineage.
- **Photography** – synthetic photography vs. documentary truth.
- **Writing and Literature** – AI continuation of authorial style (living or deceased).
- **Dance and Choreography** – motion‑capture archives used to generate new works.
- **Architectural Design** – generative design trained on culturally specific forms.
- **Scientific Collaboration** – co‑authorship with AI systems on research outputs.

---

# **4. Cultural Heritage, Stewardship & Appropriation**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **AI Trained on Indigenous Cultural Materials** – consent, sacredness, ownership.
- **UNESCO Cultural Heritage Data Projects** – preservation vs. extraction.
- **Generative Models Reproducing Folk Traditions** – ethics of tradition replication.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Comparative study of appropriation across cultures or disciplines.
- Evaluate a generative system for cultural fidelity and ethical alignment.

---

# **5. Human–AI Collaboration & Agency**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **AI as a Decision‑Making Teammate** – responsibility diffusion.
- **Anthropomorphized AI Agents** – identity and emotional manipulation.
- **Autonomous Vehicles** – ethical dilemmas operationalized in code.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Evaluate chatbot or assistant behavior for emergent agency.
- Construct a multi‑agent collaborative task (human + multiple AIs).

---

# **6. Social‑Media Ethics, Identity & Representation**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **Algorithmic Amplification** – radicalization and emotional targeting.
- **Avatar Identity in Virtual Spaces** – anonymity, role fluidity, community norms.
- **Meme Culture & Appropriation** – stereotype propagation.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Ethnography of an online community.
- Case study on moderation decisions and ethical guideline enforcement.

---

# **7. Legal Frameworks & Algorithmic Governance (EU AI Act)**
### **Instructor Examples**
- **AI System Misclassification** – risk categories and real-world harms.
- **GDPR Conflicts** – prediction based on legally collected data.
- **Transparency vs. Trade Secrets** – balancing regulation and innovation.

### **Student‑Directed Examples**
- Rewrite an article of the AI Act for a chosen system.
- Classify an existing AI system under the EU risk framework.

---

# **8. Guidelines for Student‑Selected Case Studies**
Any student‑selected case study must:
1. Contain **ethical ambiguity** (not trivial right/wrong).  
2. Involve **multiple forms of mediation** (technical, cultural, legal, communicative).  
3. Allow **BBS mapping** (multiple agents in multiple spaces).  
4. Have **societal, cultural, or legal implications**.  
5. Be **researchable** with published evidence or documented events.

### **Examples of Student‑Initiated Domains**
- AI therapy and emotional companions.  
- AI in immigration or border control.  
- Environmental data ethics and climate modeling.  
- Remote proctoring and student surveillance.  
- Political bots and discourse shaping.  
- Generative AI in religious or ritual contexts.  
- Automated journalism and authenticity.  
- Digital twins and posthumous avatars.

---

# **Purpose of the Case Study Portfolio**
This portfolio supports:
- Weekly discussions and exploratory writing.  
- Team and multi‑agent projects.  
- The **final project**, in which students construct a deeply researched ethical analysis using BBS mapping, multimodal evidence, and policy or cultural frameworks.

This list is flexible and evolves with emerging technologies and student interests.
