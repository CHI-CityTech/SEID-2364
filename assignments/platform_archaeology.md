# SEID 2364 – Assignment: Platform Archaeology

**Ethical Distance, Enshittification, and Social Media**

---

## Assignment Overview

This assignment asks you to investigate **ethical change over time** in a major digital platform by using archived web materials as evidence. Rather than evaluating a platform based on its current state alone, conduct a *historical and structural analysis* of how ethical relationships between users, platforms, and economic actors have evolved.

Treat the platform interface, policy language, and user affordances as **ethical artifacts**—designed mediation systems that encode power, responsibility, and distance. The goal is not to judge intent but to understand how ethical behavior becomes easier or harder as platforms scale, monetize, and consolidate control.

This investigation directly supports core SEID themes:
- Ethical behavior within socio-technical systems
- Social media as a mediated ethical environment
- Monopoly, ownership, and incentive structures
- Ethical distance and responsibility diffusion
- Application of the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Analyze ethical change as a **systemic process**, not an individual failure
- Use historical interface and policy evidence to support ethical claims
- Apply BBS concepts (distance, mediation, agency, ownership) to real platforms
- Identify how design and monetization affect ethical behavior
- Articulate the relationship between platform power and user agency

---

## Platform Selection

Choose **one** platform to investigate. Examples include:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok
- X / Twitter
- Reddit
- Discord
- Spotify
- Amazon Marketplace

Select a platform that:
- Has existed for several years
- Has undergone visible changes in monetization or governance
- Meaningfully mediates social interaction, attention, or creative labor

---

## Source Material: Historical Evidence

Use archived versions of platform pages via the **Wayback Machine (Internet Archive)**.

Focus on **text-heavy, policy- or control-oriented pages** such as:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Community Standards
- Data download / export pages
- Ad preferences or monetization pages
- Account deletion or deactivation flows

Avoid focusing primarily on the feed or homepage, as these are often poorly archived and algorithmically opaque.

---

## Required Time Slices

Select **at least three** historical snapshots of the *same page*:

- **Early phase** – user-growth or mission-driven period
- **Middle phase** – monetization and scaling period
- **Recent phase** – current or near-current version

Include additional snapshots if they reveal meaningful transitions.

## Investigation Tasks

### 1. Interface & Language Analysis

Document how the page changes over time:

- Shifts in tone or complexity of language
- Increased legal abstraction or indirection
- Changes in visibility of user controls
- Increase in steps, links, or nested menus
- Highlight where responsibility or clarity appears to move *away* from the user

### 2. Ethical Distance Analysis (BBS)

Using BBS concepts, analyze how ethical distance changes:

- **Agency:** What meaningful actions can users take at each stage?
- **Distance:** How far is the user from consequences or control?
- **Mediation:** How many layers exist between user intent and outcome?
- **Ownership:** Who owns data, identity, audience, or labor?
- **Opacity:** What becomes harder to see, verify, or understand?

Describe how the mediation pathway evolves.

### 3. Narrative Analysis: "Enshittification"

Consider how the platform's value proposition has shifted. Apply the concept of **enshittification** (gradual degradation of service for end-users to benefit shareholders):

- What benefits were originally promised to users?
- How have those benefits changed or eroded?
- What incentive structures explain the changes?
- Who benefits from the current state?

### 4. BBS Mediation Map

Create a visual diagram showing:

- How power and responsibility flow between user, platform, and economic actors
- Key vectors of mediation (data, attention, algorithms, policies)
- Points where ethical distance increased over time
- Nodes where responsibility became diffuse

## Resources

- **Internet Archive Wayback Machine:** https://web.archive.org/
- **Enshittification concept:** Cory Doctorow's writings and talks
- **BBS Glossary:** See resources folder in course repository
- **Platform-specific case studies:** Research in HCI, media studies journals

## Submission Guidelines

- **Format:** PDF or Markdown in course GitHub repository
- **Due Date:** See class schedule
- **Peer Review:** Exchange with one colleague; provide feedback

**This assignment models ethical inquiry as historical investigation. By treating platforms as designed systems that evolve under economic pressure, you develop literacy in recognizing how responsibility and user agency shift over time—a key competence in data science ethics.**
