# SEID 2364 – Assignment
## Platform Archaeology: Ethical Distance, Enshittification, and Social Media

---

### Assignment Overview
This assignment asks you to investigate **ethical change over time** in a major digital platform by using archived web materials as evidence. Rather than evaluating a platform based on its current state alone, you will conduct a *historical and structural analysis* of how ethical relationships between users, platforms, and economic actors have evolved.

You will treat the platform interface, policy language, and user affordances as **ethical artifacts**—designed mediation systems that encode power, responsibility, and distance. The goal is not to judge intent, but to understand how ethical behavior becomes easier or harder as platforms scale, monetize, and consolidate control.

This investigation directly supports core SEID themes:
- Ethical behavior within socio-technical systems
- Social media as a mediated ethical environment
- Monopoly, ownership, and incentive structures
- Ethical distance and responsibility diffusion
- Application of the Balanced Blended Space (BBS) framework

---

### Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will be able to:
- Analyze ethical change as a **systemic process**, not an individual failure
- Use historical interface and policy evidence to support ethical claims
- Apply BBS concepts (distance, mediation, agency, ownership) to real platforms
- Identify how design and monetization affect ethical behavior
- Articulate the relationship between platform power and user agency

---

### Platform Selection
Choose **one** platform to investigate. Examples include (but are not limited to):
- Facebook
- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok
- X / Twitter
- Reddit
- Discord
- Spotify
- Amazon Marketplace

You should select a platform that:
- Has existed for several years
- Has undergone visible changes in monetization or governance
- Meaningfully mediates social interaction, attention, or creative labor

---

### Source Material: Historical Evidence
You will use archived versions of platform pages accessed via the **Wayback Machine (Internet Archive)**.

Focus on **text-heavy, policy- or control-oriented pages**, such as:
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Community Standards
- Data download / export pages
- Ad preferences or monetization pages
- Account deletion or deactivation flows

Avoid focusing primarily on the feed or homepage, as these are often poorly archived and algorithmically opaque.

---

### Required Time Slices
Select **at least three** historical snapshots of the *same page*:

- **Early phase** – user-growth or mission-driven period
- **Middle phase** – monetization and scaling period
- **Recent phase** – current or near-current version

You may include additional snapshots if they reveal meaningful transitions.

---

### Investigation Tasks

#### 1. Interface & Language Analysis
Document how the page changes over time:
- Shifts in tone or complexity of language
- Increased legal abstraction or indirection
- Changes in visibility of user controls
- Increase in steps, links, or nested menus

Identify where responsibility or clarity appears to move *away* from the user.

---

#### 2. Ethical Distance Analysis (BBS)
Using BBS concepts, analyze how ethical distance changes across time:

- **Agency**: What meaningful actions can users take at each stage?
- **Distance**: How far is the user from consequences or control?
- **Mediation**: How many layers exist between user intent and outcome?
- **Ownership**: Who owns data, identity, audience, or labor?
- **Opacity**: What becomes harder to see, verify, or understand?

Describe how the mediation pathway evolves from earlier to later versions.

---

#### 3. Enshittification Assessment
Evaluate whether the platform follows a recognizable pattern of degradation:
- Does the system shift from user benefit → business partners → platform owners?
- Are ethical choices increasingly constrained by design?
- At what point does ethical participation become difficult or unrealistic?

Support your assessment with *specific evidence* from the archived materials.

---

#### 4. Monopoly & Exit Analysis
Address the structural context:
- What makes leaving the platform difficult?
- What network effects or switching costs exist?
- Is ethical exit a realistic option for users or creators?

Discuss how monopoly or market dominance amplifies ethical distance.

---

### Deliverables

Submit **one** of the following formats:

- Written essay (approx. 1500–2000 words)
- Structured report with screenshots and diagrams
- Visual essay or annotated interface timeline

All submissions must include:
- Clearly labeled time slices
- At least one BBS mediation description or diagram
- Direct quotations or screenshots from archived pages
- Explicit discussion of ethical distance and agency

---

### Assessment Criteria
Your work will be evaluated on:
- Quality and relevance of historical evidence
- Depth of ethical and structural analysis
- Effective use of BBS concepts
- Clarity of argument and organization
- Ability to distinguish systemic ethics from individual blame

---

### Important Notes
- This is **not** a platform review or opinion piece.
- You are analyzing **design and structure**, not personal experience alone.
- Ethical claims must be supported by observable evidence.
- Screenshots and citations should clearly reference dates and sources.

---

### Guiding Question
> *How do mediation, ownership, and distance reshape ethical behavior as platforms scale?*

This question should guide every stage of your investigation.
